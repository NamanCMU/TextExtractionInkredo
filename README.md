# TextExtractionInkredo
Extracting text from a document image

There are two files:
1. Very basic and crude implementation: Run it in the terminal using: python3 documentSegment.py Set1 (Folder which contains images)
2. K-means clustering implementation: Run it in the terminal using: python3 kMeansClustering.py Set1/ (Folder which has the images)

It saves the cropped images in the same folder (adds 'cropped' at the end of the image)
